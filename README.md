# Learn C The Hard Way By Zed A. Shaw

- This book was recommended by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau, "the author of Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces".
- The process of learning C language by creating and breaking programs was not just about leaning a 'programming language', rather it helped understand computers themselves and provided deeper insignts when learning other languages.
